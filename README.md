func selectedOption(option: String) {

// do something with option selected

}

// Create Delegate Variable
var pickerDelegate: UIPickerDelegate

// Create String Array of Options
let optionsArray = ["option1", "option2", "option3"]

// Instantiate new UIPicker with array of options
var newPicker = UIPicker(options: optionsArray)

// Set newPicker Delegate to ViewController
newPicker?.pickerDelegate = self

// Set TextField inputView to newPicker
self.someRandomTextField.inputView = newPicker

```

##CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 0.39.0+ is required to build UIPicker 0.0.1+.

To integrate UIPicker into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'UIPicker', '~> 0.0.1'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
